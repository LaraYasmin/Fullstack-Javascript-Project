Hi! This files are a project that I did to have some fun and remember of old concepts of React.

- I did the design of the screens (You can check here: https://www.figma.com/design/33E6zj4xMdehVwZm32QaH6/MarkedUP-(personal-project)?node-id=0-1&t=bNWg2mz2r3Z4Qzd3-1)
- I did the back and frontend (node - react)
- The idea is to deploy this app sooner (still in development)
- The MarkedUP company is fake, this is just a personal project to study.

Thank you for come here!
